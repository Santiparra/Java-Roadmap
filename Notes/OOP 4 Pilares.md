# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding complexity inside a "black box" so that it's easier to focus on the problem at hand.

# Abstraction

Abstraction helps us handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details. Sounds like encapsulation, right? They're so similar that it's almost not worth worrying about the difference...almost.

- Abstraction vs encapsulation

  1. Abstraction is about creating a simple interface for complex behavior. It focuses on what's exposed.
  2. Encapsulation is about hiding internal state. It focuses on tucking implementation details away so no one depends on them.

Abstraction is more about reducing complexity, encapsulation is more about maintaining the integrity of system internals.

# Inheritance

We've made it to the holy grail of object-oriented programming: inheritance. Non-OOP languages like Go and Rust allow for encapsulation and abstraction features as nearly every language does. Inheritance, on the other hand, tends to be unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby.

### What is inheritance?

Inheritance allows one class, the "child" class, to inherit the properties and methods of another class, the "parent" class.

This powerful language feature helps us avoid writing a lot of the same code twice. It allows us to DRY (don't repeat yourself) up our code.

# Polymorphism

While inheritance is the most unique trait of object-oriented languages, polymorphism is probably the most powerful. Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

  - "poly"="many"
  - "morph"="form".

For example, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors.
